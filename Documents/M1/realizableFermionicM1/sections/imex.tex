\section{Positivity-Preserving IMEX Schemes}
\label{sec:imex}

In this section we summarize the IMEX scheme used for the realizability-preserving DG-IMEX method for the two-moment model developed in Section~\ref{sec:realizableDGIMEX}.  
The semi-discretization of the moment equations with the DG method given in Eq.~\eqref{eq:semidiscreteDG} results in a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) in each element of the form
\begin{equation}
  \dot{\vect{u}}
  =\vect{\cT}(\vect{u})+\f{1}{\tau}\,\vect{\cQ}(\vect{u}),
  \label{eq:ode}
\end{equation}
where $\vect{u}$ are the degrees of freedom evolved with the DG method; i.e., for a test space spanned by $\{\phi_{i}(\vect{x})\}_{i=1}^{N}\in\bbV^{k}$, we let
\begin{equation}
  \vect{u}=\f{1}{|\bK|}\Big(\,\int_{\bK}\vect{\cM}_{h}\,\phi_{1}\,d\vect{x},\int_{\bK}\vect{\cM}_{h}\,\phi_{2}\,d\vect{x},\ldots,\int_{\bK}\vect{\cM}_{h}\,\phi_{N}\,d\vect{x}\,\Big)^{T}.
\end{equation}
The transport term $\vect{\cT}$ is due to the second and third term in the left-hand side of Eq.~\eqref{eq:semidiscreteDG}, while the collision term $\vect{\cQ}$ is due to the right-hand side of Eq.~\eqref{eq:semidiscreteDG}.  

In the application of interest to us, the collision term is stiff ($\tau\ll1$) and must be treated with implicit methods, while we can resolve the time scales induced by the transport term, which we will treat with explicit methods; i.e., we will use IMEX methods \cite{pareschiRusso_2005}.  
Until recently, high-order (second or higher order temporal accuracy) positivity-preserving IMEX methods with time step restrictions solely due to the transport operator were not known.  
Chertock et al. \cite{chertock_etal_2015} presented second order accurate IMEX schemes with a correction step.  
The correction step includes the transport operator, and positivity is subject to a time step restriction $\dt\propto1/\sqrt{\tau}$.  
More recently, Hu et al. \cite{hu_etal_2017}, presented new IMEX schemes for a class of BGK-type collision operators with a correction step that does not include the transport operator.  
In this case, positivity is only subject to time step restrictions stemming from the transport operator.  
These $s$-stage IMEX schemes take the following form \cite{hu_etal_2017}
\begin{align}
  \vect{u}^{(i)}
  &=\vect{u}^{n}
  +\dt\sum_{j=1}^{i-1}\tilde{a}_{ij}\,\vect{\cT}(\vect{u}^{(j)})
  +\dt\sum_{j=1}^{i}a_{ij}\,\f{1}{\tau}\,\vect{\cQ}(\vect{u}^{(j)}),
  \quad i=1,\ldots,s, \label{imexStages} \\
  \tilde{\vect{u}}^{n+1}
  &=\vect{u}^{n}
  +\dt\sum_{i=1}^{s}\tilde{w}_{i}\,\vect{\cT}(\vect{u}^{(i)})
  +\dt\sum_{i=1}^{s}w_{i}\,\f{1}{\tau}\,\vect{\cQ}(\vect{u}^{(i)}), \label{imexIntermediate} \\
  \vect{u}^{n+1}
  &=\tilde{\vect{u}}^{n+1}-\alpha\,\dt^{2}\,\f{1}{\tau^{2}}\,\vect{\cQ}'(\vect{u}^{*})\,\vect{\cQ}(\vect{u}^{n+1}), \label{eq:imexCorrection}
\end{align}
where, as in standard IMEX schemes, $(\tilde{a}_{ij})$ and $(a_{ij})$, components of $s\times s$ matrices, and the vectors $(\tilde{w}_{1},\ldots,\tilde{w}_{s})^{T}$ and $(w_{1},\ldots,w_{s})^{T}$ must satisfy certain order conditions \cite{pareschiRusso_2005}.  
The coefficient in the correction step is positive, $\alpha>0$.  
For globally stiffly accurate (GSA) IMEX schemes, $\tilde{w}_{i}=\tilde{a}_{si}$ and $w_{i}=a_{si}$ for $i=\{1,\ldots,s\}$, so that $\tilde{\vect{u}}^{n+1}=\vect{u}^{(s)}$.  
To prove the positivity-preserving property of the IMEX scheme, Hu et al. \cite{hu_etal_2017} rewrite the stage values in Eq.~\eqref{imexStages} as
\begin{equation}
  \vect{u}^{(i)}
  =c_{i0}\,\vect{u}^{n}+\sum_{j=1}^{i-1}c_{ij}\Big[\,\vect{u}^{(j)}+\hat{c}_{ij}\,\dt\,\vect{\cT}(\vect{u}^{(j)})\,\Big]
  +a_{ii}\,\dt\,\f{1}{\tau}\,\vect{Q}(\vect{u}^{(i)}),
  \label{eq:imexStagesRewrite}
\end{equation}
where $c_{i0}$, $c_{ij}$, and $\hat{c}_{ij}=\tilde{c}_{ij}/c_{ij}$ are computed from $\tilde{a}_{ij}$ and $a_{ij}$ (see \cite{hu_etal_2017} for details).  
Importantly, $c_{i0}+\sum_{j=1}^{i-1}c_{ij}=1$.  
The positivity-preserving property follows from requiring $a_{ii}>0$ and $c_{i0}\ge0$, for $i=1,\ldots,s$, and $c_{ij},\tilde{c}_{ij}\ge0$, for $i=2,\ldots,s$, $j=1,\ldots,s-1$.
