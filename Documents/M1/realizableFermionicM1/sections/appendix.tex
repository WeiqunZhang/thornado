\section{Butcher Tableau for IMEX Schemes}

For easy reference, we include the Butcher tableau for the IMEX schemes considered in this paper, which can be written in the standard double Butcher tableau
\begin{equation}
  \begin{array}{c | c}
    \tilde{\vect{c}} & \tilde{A} \\
    \hline
    & \tilde{\vect{w}}^{T}
  \end{array}
  \qquad
  \begin{array}{c | c}
    \vect{c} & A \\
    \hline
    \alpha & \vect{w}^{T}
  \end{array},
\end{equation}
where the \emph{explicit tableau} (left; components adorned with a tilde) represent the explicit part of the IMEX scheme, and the \emph{implicit tableau} (right; unadorned components) represent the implicit part of the IMEX scheme.  
For $s$ stages, $\tilde{A}=(\tilde{a}_{ij})$, $\tilde{a}_{ij}=0$ for $j\ge i$, and $A=(a_{ij})$, $a_{ij}=0$ for $j>i$, are $s\times s$ matrices, and $\tilde{\vect{w}}=(\tilde{w}_{1},\ldots,\tilde{w}_{s})^{T}$ and $\vect{w}=(w_{1},\ldots,w_{s})^{T}$.  
The vectors $\tilde{\vect{c}}=(\tilde{c}_{1},\ldots,\tilde{c}_{s})^{T}$ and $\vect{c}=(c_{1},\ldots,c_{s})^{T}$, used for non autonomous systems, satisfy $\tilde{c}_{i}=\sum_{j=1}^{i-1}\tilde{a}_{ij}$ and $c_{i}=\sum_{j=1}^{i}a_{ij}$.  
For the implicit tableau, we have included the scalar $\alpha$, used for the correction step in Eq.~\eqref{eq:imexCorrection}.  

\paragraph{IMEX PA2}

A second-order accurate, positivity-preserving IMEX scheme of type $A$ (the matrix $A$ is invertible) was given in \cite{hu_etal_2017}.  
We refer to this scheme as IMEX PA2.  
For this scheme, the non-zero components of $\tilde{A}$ and $A$ are given by
\begin{align}
  \tilde{a}_{21} &= 0.7369502715, \nonumber \\
  \tilde{a}_{31} &= 0.3215281691, \quad \tilde{a}_{32} = 0.6784718309, \nonumber \\
  a_{11} &= 0.6286351712, \nonumber \\
  a_{21} &= 0.2431004655, \quad a_{22} = 0.1959392570, \nonumber \\
  a_{31} &= 0.4803651051, \quad a_{32} = 0.0746432814, \quad a_{33} = 0.4449916135. \nonumber
\end{align}
The coefficient in the correction step is $\alpha = 0.2797373792$ and the CFL constant is $c_{sch} = 0.5247457524$.
This scheme is globally stiffly accurate (GSA), so that $\tilde{w}_{i}=\tilde{a}_{3i}$ and $w_{i}=a_{3i}$ for $i\le3$.

\paragraph{IMEX PA2+}

We here give another second-order accurate, sitivity-preserving IMEX scheme of type $A$, named IMEX PA2+, which has a lager $c_{sch}$ than IMEX PA2.
It was chosen from $10^{6}$ coefficient groups that satisfy both the second-order accuracy requirement and the positivity-preserving requirement.
IMEX PA2+ is the one has the largest ($c_{sch} = 0.895041066934$). 
Its non-zero components of $\tilde{A}$ and $A$ are given by
\begin{align}
  \tilde{a}_{21} &= 0.909090909090909, \nonumber \\
  \tilde{a}_{31} &= 0.450000000000000, \quad \tilde{a}_{32} = 0.550000000000000, \nonumber \\
  a_{11} &= 0.521932391842510, \nonumber \\
  a_{21} &= 0.479820781424967, \quad a_{22} = 0.002234534340252, \nonumber \\
  a_{31} &= 0.499900000000000, \quad a_{32} = 0.001100000000000, \quad a_{33} = 0.499000000000000. \nonumber
\end{align}
The coefficient in the correction step is $\alpha = 0.260444263529413$.  
This scheme is also a GSA scheme: $\tilde{w}_{i}=\tilde{a}_{3i}$ and $w_{i}=a_{3i}$ for $i\le3$.

\paragraph{IMEX PC2}

A second-order accurate, positivity-preserving, diffusion accurate IMEX scheme was given in \cite{mcclareen_2008}.  
We refer to this scheme as IMEX PC2.  
Its non-zero components of $\tilde{A}$ and $A$ are given by
\begin{align}
  \tilde{a}_{21} &= 0.5, \nonumber \\
  \tilde{a}_{32} &= 1, \nonumber \\
  a_{22} &= 0.5, \nonumber \\
  a_{33} &= 1.0. \nonumber
\end{align}
And $\tilde{w}_{i}=\tilde{a}_{3i} = w_{i}=a_{3i}$ for $i\le3$.
A common choice of this scheme is $c_{sch} = 0.3$.

\paragraph{IMEX RKCB2}

A second-order accurate, diffusion accurate, L-stable, strong-stability-preserving IMEX scheme was given in \cite{cavaglieriBewley2015}.  
We refer to this scheme as IMEX RKCB2.  
Its non-zero components of $\tilde{A}$ and $A$ are given by
\begin{align}
  \tilde{a}_{21} &= 2/5, \nonumber \\
  \tilde{a}_{32} &= 1, \nonumber \\
  a_{22} &= 2/5, \nonumber \\
  a_{32} &= 5/6, \quad a_{33} = 1/6. \nonumber
\end{align}
And $w_{i} = a_{3i} = \tilde{w}_{i}$ for stiff accuracy.

\paragraph{IMEX SSP2332}

A second-order accurate, diffusion accurate, L-stable, strong-stability-preserving IMEX scheme was given in \cite{pareschiRusso_2005}.  
We refer to this scheme as IMEX SSP2332.  
Its non-zero components of $\tilde{A}$ and $A$ are given by
\begin{align}
  \tilde{a}_{21} &= 1/2, \nonumber \\
  \tilde{a}_{31} &= 1/2, \quad \tilde{a}_{32} = 1/2, \nonumber \\
  a_{11} &= 1/4, \nonumber \\
  a_{22} &= 1/4, \nonumber \\
  a_{31} &= 1/3, \quad a_{32} = 1/3, \quad a_{33} = 1/3. \nonumber
\end{align}
And $w_{i} = a_{3i} = \tilde{w}_{i}$ for stiff accuracy.

A second-order accurate, strong-stability-preserving explicit Runge-Kutta scheme, referred as SSPRK2, has the following non-zero components:
\begin{align}
  \tilde{a}_{21} &= 1, \nonumber \\
  \tilde{w}_{1} &= 1/2, \quad \tilde{w}_{2} = 1/2. \nonumber 
\end{align}

It has the following non-zero components:
\begin{align}
  \tilde{a}_{21} &= 1, \nonumber \\
  \tilde{a}_{31} &= 1/4, \quad \tilde{a}_{32} = 1/4, \nonumber \\
  \tilde{w}_{1} &= 1/6, \quad \tilde{w}_{2} = 1/6, \quad \tilde{w}_{3} =2/3 \nonumber
