\section{Introduction}

Core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are the explosions of massive stars that end their lives.
They are the dominant source of heavy elements and play important roles in many astrophysical phenomena, such as neutron star and black hole formation.  
Furthermore, these explosions occur at energies and densities relevant to address fundamental questions in nuclear, particle, and gravitational physics. 
A solid theoretical framework for the CCSN explosion mechanism may help answer important questions in fundamental physics.\cite{janka_etal_2007}

One essential part of the explosion mechanism is neutrino transport.
The neutrino energy deposition drives the CCSN explosion.\cite{mezzacappaMesser_1999}
Ideally, neutrino transport would be modeled by the Boltzmann transport equation, which is an integro-partial-differential equation evolving a phase-space distribution function $f$.\cite{Bruenn_1985}
Simulating the neutrino transport implies finding a solution of the Boltzmann equation for a specific domain and period with acceptable accuracy.

However, solving the Boltzmann transport equation full-dimensionally is expensive.
To balance physical fidelity and computational expediency, an approximate method called the two-moment method has been adopted.\cite{mezzacappaMesser_1999}
Using the two-moment method, the evolved variables are the zeroth and first angular moments of the distribution function $f$ -- the spectral particle density $\cJ$ and flux $\bcH$, respectively.
However, the transport term in the Boltzmann transport equation has the dot product of the velocity vector and the gradient of the phase-space distribution function as its form.
Integrating this term with an unit direction vector as the weight function couples the moment equations: it introduces the second angular moment $\bcK$ to the first moment $\bcH$'s equation.
Knowledge of $\bcK$ is needed to close the two-moment equation system.
Therefore, an algebraic closure that gives a predicted $\bcK$ given $\cJ$ and $\bcH$ is needed.
The better the closure predicts $\bcK$, the more accurate the two-moment method. 
Two-moment method has been widely applied with different algebraic closures, such as the Minerbo\cite{minerbo_1978} closure(e.g.~{O'Connor} and {Couch}\cite{oConnorCouch_2018}, Pan and et al\cite{pan_etal_2018}, Glas et al\cite{glas_etal_2018}, and Just et al\cite{just_etal_2018} ) and the Levermore\cite{levermore_1984} closure(e.g.~Vartanyan et al\cite{vartanyan_etal_2018}, Cabezon et al\cite{cabezon_etal_2018}, and Kuroda et al\cite{kuroda_etal_2016}). 

Applying the two-moment method does simplify the problem, but doesn't guarantee an affordable solution.
To be precise, how to discrete the continuous equation system given by the two-moment method and solve the discretized system efficiently is remain a question.
In fact, the time scales of neutrino interactions with the background ($\sim\mathcal{O}(10^{-13})$~second) is short compared to the duration of the CCSN explosion ($\sim\mathcal{O}(1)$~second).  
This means that a lot of time step would be needed for solving the system fully explicitly. 
On the other hand, solving the moment equations fully implicitly requires inverting globally many band-structured matrices whose sizes depend on the spatial discretization.
Such a global inversion is both expensive and unfriendly to parallelization.
To circumvent these challenges, implicit-explicit (IMEX) methods are taken into consideration.
By treating the transport terms in the two-moment equations explicitly and the collision terms implicitly, IMEX methods are subject only to a time step governed by the explicit transport terms, and the matrices to be inverted are block diagonal.
Therefore, IMEX methods require fewer time steps comparing with fully explicit method, and the calculation for each step is easily parallelizable.  
%For a non-relativistic system where the propagating speed of gravitional wave and fluid is much slower than the light speed, fully implicit method is a better choice for neutrino transport in CCSN simulation.\cite{cernohorskyVanWeert_1992}(read ?)
For a relativistic circumstance that we have, where the gravity, fluid, and neutrino have a relativistic propagating speed, IMEX method is an efficient method.

To model neutrino transport using two-moment method, two things need to be chosen carefully: an algebraic closure based on Fermi-Dirac statistic for closing the two-moment equations and a convex-invariant, diffusion-accurate IMEX scheme to ensure a physical result.
Since the neutrino distribution function is bounded ($f\in[0,1]$) by the Pauli exclusion principle, its moments as weight integrals of a bounded function over domain $\omega\in\bbS^{2}$ are also bounded.
We call the moments satisfying the constraints due to Fermi-Dirac statistics \textit{realizable moments}.
The algebraic closure should give a realizable $\bcK$, and the well-posedness of the closure requires realizable $\cJ$ and $\bcH$.
It explains why an algebraic closure based on Fermi-Dirac statistics is needed.
Realizability of $\cJ$ and $\bcH$ after each time step requires a convex-invariant IMEX scheme.
Since the realizable moments form a convex set, it is possible to construct a realizability-preserving method with convex-invariant IMEX scheme for two-moment neutrino transport.
What's more, the physics of neutrino transport in CCSN requires the IMEX scheme to be diffusion-accurate.

The study of moment realizability and realizability-preserving method with diffusion-accurate IMEX schemes motivate this work.
Gottlieb et al\cite{gottlieb_etal_2001} showed standard IMEX scheme with strong-stability-preserving can't have an order higher than first without a restrict time step requirement.
To have second-order (or higher-order) accuracy, some correction steps are needed.
Unfortunately, the correction steps can deteriorate the accuracy of the IMEX scheme in the diffusion limit or restrict the time step.
To keep things simple, we focus on IMEX schemes without correction steps and require them to be high-order (second or higher order) in the streaming limit and diffusion-accurate.
We call these IMEX schemes \textit{PD-ARS}.

\texttt{thornado} is our toolkit for high-order neutrino-radiation hydrodynamics based on high-order Runge-Kutta Discontinuous Galerkin (RKDG) methods.
It is developed at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville and Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
It currently solves the Euler equations for fluid dynamics and the two-moment approximation of the radiative transfer equation, both in the non-relativistic limits.\cite{endeve_etal_2018}

Section~\ref{se:SpacialDiscretization} gives a first-order finite-volume spatial discretization and shows how the spatial discretization preserves constraints in an IMEX step;
Section~\ref{se:TimeIntegration} discusses how to use convex combination to construct PD-ARS scheme and two PD-ARS schemes, one with second-order accuracy in the streaming limit and the other with third-order accuracy in the same limit;
Section~\ref{se:NumericalTests} presents the results of the numerical tests, which demonstrate the properties of the PD-ARS schemes; Section~\ref{se:Conclusion} summarizes the achievements of this paper and discusses future works.
